# cloud-spike
Experimental spring cloud project 

The aim of this project is to use the bare minimum code and configuration necessary to stand up Spring Cloud provided offerings and specific micro services that exist and interact in that space. It is intended to take into consideration the development of such services by coping with full or partial deployment into docker containers. Again with minimal configuration.
